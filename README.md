* 👋 I'm Nathan, an Engineering Analyst at [Arenova Capital](https://arennova.com), where I leverage technology to streamline deal sourcing and analysis.
* 🏫 Before Arenova, I was an Honors computer science student at Clemson University. I withdrew in 2024 before completing my degree.
* ⛰️ For fun, I love hiking, photography, cooking... and of course, coding!

* 👋 I'm Nathan, an Honors computer science student at Clemson University.
* 💼 I recently interned as a Summer Analyst at [Arenova Capital](https://arenova.com)—and before that, I was a Software Engineering intern at [Expeditors International](https://www.expeditors.com/).
* ⛰️ For fun, I love hiking, photography, cooking... and of course, coding!
